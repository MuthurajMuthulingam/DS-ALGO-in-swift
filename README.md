# DS-ALGO-in-swift
Solving DS-ALGO problems using swift language in play-ground. Problems regarding on Tree, Graph, Linked-list, Greedy-Algo, 
Dynamic Programming etc...

A. Tree Problems :

1. BST Insertion
2. BST Deletion 
3. kth Smallest Element in BST 
4. Is Binary tree a BST 
5. Least Common Ancestor(lca) between 2 nodes in a BST. 
6. Inorder Successor and Inorder Predecessor of a node in BST
7. Print BST nodes within a specific range 
8. Convert a sorted array into BST 
9. Vertical Printing of a tree (using the horizontal distance from root concept)

B. Heap :

1. Heap Sort 
2. Heap operations (insertion , deletion , decreaseKey, ExtractMin, heapify, createHeap)


C. Linked List :

1. Reverse a linked list.

D. Dynamic Programing :

1. Gold-mine problem 
2. Word Break Problem.

E. Array :

1. Left Rotation.
2. An Array (say arr2) is a subset of another array (say arr1) - using hash-table 
3. Array elements pair is summed to a given number (x) - using hash-table.
4. Array contains Duplicate elements within k distance - Brute Forece approach & Hash-table approach.
5. Symmetric pairs present in an array or not - using Hash-table O(arr.size)

G. Graph :

1. DFS (Depth First Search) of connected / disconnected Graph 
2. BFS (Breadth First Search) of graph
